A: ,I just found out through Twitter that Xanalia is launching the ULTRAMAN NFT! 🤩
A:,"Anyone here who can tell me when is the NFT drop?
"
,
B: ,Yo A! Welcome to the community 😃
B: ,Your wait is going to be over very very soon 😄
B: ,All of us are excited for the BIG drop too!!!
,
A: ,That sounds cool!!
A: ,I’ve never bought any nft from Xanalia before?
A:,Can you guide me @B what kind of platform it is?
,
B: ,You’ve come to the right place 😃
B:,"Once you get to know how user-friendly XANALIA is, you’re not going anywhere else"
,
C:,Hi guys! What’s up?
,
B:,Hey @C
,
C:,I saw an ultraman nft on opensea 🤔
,
B: ,It’s not original
B: ,Xanalia partnered with Heroes Inc to gain copyrights to the ultraman character
B: ,the original nft can only be bought from here
,
A: ,which network is available on Xanalia?
,
B: ,XANALIA has 3 networks
B:,"Polygon, BSC, and Ethereum"
,
A:,That’s awesome
,
C: ,I’m so glad they are using polygon
C:,Can’t pay high fee 😭
,
A:,no high transaction fees for me dude! 👻
,
C:,Why even think of ethereum? 🤷‍♂️
C:,I mean who in their right minds would go for soaring gas fees and slow transaction speed 😐
,
D:,Hey guys! interesting convo
D:,I'd like to add my 2 cents
D:,"I see many polygon supporters here but the kind of traction it is getting, soon you will see high prices 😫"
,
B:,Can't say what the future holds for us 🤷‍♂️
,
D:,"Ain’t checking forecasts bro? Rn, Polygon might be less popular as compared to BSC but all staking features are on its side."
,
A: ,"Well, Polygon noticed ethereum’s disadvantage way before than binance did"
,
B:,Yeah but BSC’s ecosystem is huge….it has more than 700 projects
,
D: ,Give it some time bro!
D: ,The low fee and quick transactions … you will see people converting
,
A: ,I think the two networks are only beginning a long road of competition
,
D:,@A agreed
D:,Hey!! I need info on XANALIA's minting charges
D:,I wanna put my NFT on sale on Xanalia. Do they charge on creatin n listing nft???
,
C: ,I see nft enthusiasts here 🤩  
,
B:,You only need to pay blockchain gas fee! XANALIA charges 2.5% of the amount when a buyer buys your NFT
,
C:,I wanna earn through nfts but no idea about how to add value
,
D:,nft is the new GOLD🎇….forget about crypto now
,
C:,I heard only rare nfts have value ☹
C:,how do I make 💰 thru them?
,
A:,no bro
A:,the value of nft is decided by the buzz it creates..demand and supply rules also apply on them
A:,nfts work like any other asset...you buy it and you don’t know the future
,
D:,who doesn’t wanna brag some cool art in their profile pic 😎
,
C:, I guess you guys can help in getting some valuable nfts in my pocket 🤭🤭🤭
,
D:,Can i get any online guide regarding crypto tax laws in different countries?
,
A:,That's a tricky question!!
A:,I wish i can find something like this too .. would be sooo helpful
,
C:,I’m still struggling to know which countries don’t ban crypto 🙄🙄🙄
,
B:,@everyone! It’s only a matter of time.. You will see the world moving to blockchain and crypto
B:,Money in crypto and assets in nft …. That’s what the new world is all about
B:,I do know that hong kong and singapore dont have tax on BTC 🥳
,
A:,I’ve heard portugal has the best laws
A:,there's no tax on the profit from crypto exchange… you can also exchange crypto with normal currency
,
D:,I can’t wait for other countries to make crypto legal
D:,only a few have started regulating cryptocurrencies 🤷‍♂️ don’t know when investors will start gettin tax benefits
,
C:,govts are being just lazzyyyy
C:,covid-19 opened more gates for crypto but they are still reluctant 🤦‍♂️
,
A:,Most countries are still confused whether to call crypto a commodity or virtual currency
A:,Even the laws around nfts are so vague
A:,I wonder what govts are going to do when nfts become more mainstream
,
B:,I feel few countries like singapore and switzrland are in the right direction
B:,Singapore’s central bank is developing a balanced environment for crypto
,
C:,@A nfts are here to stay
C:,"artists, musicians love emmm!!"
C:,nfts have gatecrashed the art world 🔥  🔥  🔥
,
D:,Some people also raise copyright issues on nfts 
,
E: ,the smart contracts have made them more secure 🥳 
E: ,I find nft more secure than traditional art
E: ,I mean how can you even tell that mona lisa in paris is no fake? 👻
,
C:,That is why I love NFTs 😍😍😍 
C:,smart contracts make them traceable
,
D:,I wonder how secure Xanalia is?
,
B:,they have partnered with chainlink to make their smart contracts stronger 💪
,
C:,I've heard we can use XANALIA's NFTs on metaverse?
,
B: ,Yeaaap!! You heard that right
,
C:,Wow!! Awesome
,
B:,You can use the NFTs in the metaverse
B:,Wait till ultraman NFT drop 🤩🤩🤩
B:,They can be used in the TCG game NFT Duel
,
D:,so cooool!!
D:,that is what everyone's aiming for!! to use NFTs in the metaverse
D:,Noborderz is way ahead in the race.. impressive!
,
A:,This is the new thinggg!!
A:,Biggies like Facebook and Microsoft are venturing into this
A:,Zuckerberg rebranded his company as he realized the potential of this technology
A:,he is inclined to make ecosystems that are more supportive of crypto and nfts
,
C:,metaverse is the next thing!!
C:,all interactions in VR 🤖🤖🤖
,
D:,fb is already an established marktplace  👌 👌 👌
D:,he is just takin it to higher levels 🚀 
D:,probably wants people to trade nfts thru it as well
,
C:,I think his aim is to let people use fiat money as well to purchase NFTs
,
B:,XANALIA already gives that option 😄 
B:,it lets you buy NFTs even if you don’t own a wallet
B:,Buyers can use their credit card instead of crypto to purchase 👍
,
A:,which wallets do they support?
,
B:,@A MetaMask and Binance chain wallet
B:,You can visit the official website xanalia.com and find the wallet icon on the top right corner
B:,Click on this and you can also find many other mobile wallets too
B:,very few marketplaces offer such convenience to buyers
,
C:,I wanna buy a wallet! Can someone help me in making the right choice?
,
D:,you should have a wallet by now .. both MetaMask and Binance chain are good options
,
C:,@D can you tell which one is better?
,
D: ,both are really good actually .. MetaMask might be better in one aspect whereas Binance wallet in another
D: ,"tbh, it’s hard for me to choose as well"
D: ,I have both
,
A:,You should get MetaMask
A:,it’s simple and easy to use 😉😉😉
,
C:,I have another question!! 🙋‍♂️
C:,Can someone also please explain the difference between custodial and non-custodial wallets
,
A:,no worries! I can help you with this one
A:,the wallet provider holds your private keys in case of custodial wallet
A:,this means that you can’t entirely control your wallet and cannot even connect it to DApps either
A:,"on the other hand, you own private keys in a non-custodial wallet"
A:,it’s the safest option only if you keep your private keys secure
A:,"also, you can connect them with DApps"
,
D:,I  think that non-custodial wallets are wayyy better
,
B:,serious investors should always keep multiple wallets
B:,the crypto world is quite volatile
,
D:,"After using MetaMask, don’t wait to get a Binance wallet"
D:,I feel they have superior services and their customer service has no match
,
A:,"agreed @D but for starters, MetaMask is better"
,
D:,"yeah, but then he should move to Binance gradually"
,
C:,Thanks guys!!
,
B:,"Since we are already talking about wallets, I’d like to talk about hot and cold wallets"
B:,I see so many people supporting hot wallets
B:,but the security risks are so high 🤯
,
A:,@B you do realize hot wallets are faster and easier to trade?
A:,I have to make quick transactions. I can’t rely on cold wallets
,
B:,I think it’s a very bad idea to store all your money in a hot wallet
B:,It’s better just to keep a low amount for instant transactions
B:,"if you want to trade, you can always send more money to your hot wallet"
,
A:,"yeah, i do the same"
A:,but a lot of transactions happening everyday 🤷‍♂️
A:,I try to keep some of my crypto in a cold wallet
A:,but can’t wait to transfer my crypto to hot wallet everytime I have to make a transaction
,
C:,🤯🤯🤯
C:,there’s so much to know about wallets
C:,I don’t think so I’m getting a hot wallet anytime soon
,
D:,do complete research before buying any wallet
D:,you never know if their security is up to the mark or not
,
C:,yeaaah
,
B:,so many scams happening .. it’s hard to trust any wallet
B:,😔😔😔
B:,but it feels one should always have a combination of trusted hot and cold wallets
,
D:,always look for the right balance between security and utility
,
A:,spot on!!
,
C:,"Yeah, I don’t trade much so I believe a cold wallet is okay for me right now"
,
A:,I was checking out the hottest trends in the NFTs and came across “fractionalized NFTs”
A:,it grabbed my interest
,
D:,new trend but I don’t think so xanalia supports it
D:,tbh I don’t even want em to
,
A:,@D why would you say that? 😮
A:,"IMO, it’s the best"
A:,not everyone has the $$ to buy NFTs .. we know that some of them are worth millions now .. fractionalized nfts are best for average buyers
,
D:,this benefit comes at the cost of regulatory implications
D:,it steers very close to unregistered securities
,
A:,nfts are cryptographically secure .. even their fractions .. if you choose reliable platforms then nothing to worry about bro 👍
,
D:,it is better to have proper knowledge and info before venturing into shared NFTs
D:,i think 🤔 people are less informed and jump into new things wayyy too soon
,
A:,"but, fractionalization will keep the NFT market moving"
A:,they open more opportunities for small investors to empower themselves
,
B:,I have to agree with @A here
B:,"the market is still experimenting a lot, but how will we learn if we don’t try new things?"
B:,shared NFTs are a security threat no doubt
B:,"but maybe if more people move towards them, we will have a solution for the security issues"
,
D:,yes @B but that needs time bro
D:,"RN, we’re not even sure the kind of rights F-NFT investor owns"
D:,it is so new .. the guidelines are so vague ..
,
B:,"@D yes, you’re right we should be careful atm"
,
A:,I agree too! Being careful is must .. but there’s no harm in exploring without putting too much at risk 😆 😉
,
D:,"I hope that issues pertaining to intellectual property rights, rights of publication and other complications get resolved"
D:,because shared NFTs can only be secure if these things are taken care of
,
B:,tbh I find this idea quite amazing
,
C:,but guys! How do fractionalized nfts get their value?
C:,"though, i love the concept but there are a few reservations"
,
D:,that is the point man!!
D:,the core thing from which nfts derive their value are being compromised in shared NFTs
,
A:,did you hear what happened with the DOGE meme nft?
A:,"when it was broken into different parts, the value skyrocketed"
A:,from $4 mn to $220 mn 🤯🤯🤯
,
B:,it’s a bit complicated
B:,but all the problems will work out
B:,I still feel shared NFTs will improve the market
,
C:,they will add liquidity to the market
C:,helping NFT community to grow 👌
,
D:,I got to know through Twitter that an nft metaverse game NFT duel is also being launched by the company
D:,Does anyone have more info about it?
,
B:,NFT Duel is a trading card game that makes use of NFTs and Metaverse to give an exceptional P2E experience to the users
B:,It is still under development and will be released earlier next year
,
D:,That's so cool! I'ma huge fan of GameFi
D:,It is the future of gaming .. and a golden chance for us gamers to earn money through gameplay
,
C:,How are NFT games different? I mean you can earn money through traditional games too 🤔
,
D:,@C There's a huge difference between the two
D:,"In traditional gaming, only the company owners get to make most of the money"
D:,"On the other hand, the NFTs are your assets in NFT based games"
D:,You can sell your NFTs at a higher price if their demand increases and earn a revenue against them
,
C:,Wow! That's interesting
,
A:,Play-to-earn is the future of gaming
A:,NFTs are going to be the economic foundation of future metaverses
A:,"How to play the game, though?"
,
B:,"It's a TCG where one can buy, sell, and play with the cards"
B:,"In simple words, it provides multiple opportunities for entertainment and to earn money"
B:,The most exciting part is that ULTRAMAN NFTs will also be soon available in NFT Duel 😄😄😄
,
A:,@B That's the best thing I've heard so far 😂
,
C:,But how do NFTs get their value within the game?
C:,I mean how are some NFTs more expensive than the other?
,
B:,"If the card is used in a successful strategy multiple times, the players will automatically feel that it's worthy"
B:,The demand of the card will increase and this will cause a hike in its value.
,
A:,I'm sure the Ultraman cards are going to have the most demand 😎
,
D:,@A yeah the fan following is crazy for the anime
,
C:,You guys are so enthusiastic about the NFT n Metaverse phenomenon
C:,This group is so informational
,
A:,😎
,
D: ,Thanks bro @C
,
A:,From where we will be able to buy the NFT card used in NFT duel?
,
B:,All the NFTs will be available on XANALIA
B:,It's the best NFT marketplace for metaverse
,
A:,What kind collections are available on Xanalia?
,
B:,XANALIA has a wide range of collections
B:,"From anime to GIFs, you will find the most amazing NFTs on the platform"
,
C:,Do they have any other famous collection apart from ultraman?
,
B:,"Yes, they had Monkey King earlier this year and are about to launch Underground City."
,
D:,I like such kind of unqiue collections.
D:,I wish more marketplaces launch avatars that can be used in the metaverse.
,
C:,Life in the metaverse is going to be the next big thing
,
A:,How can we purchase an NFT through Xanalia?
,
B:,XANALIA has two selling methods.
B:,You can either buy the NFT at a fixed price or take part in an auction.
,
D:,How does the auction process work?
,
B:,"If you wish to buy an NFT, you bid for it. "
B:,"If your bid is the highest, you will buy it. But if someone else made the highest bid, your money will return to your wallet."
,
C:,When can we bid?
,
B:,It depends on the bidding time set by the seller.
,
C:,What happens if there is no auction?
,
B:,@C It's simple then. The seller sets a fixed price at which the buyer makes the purchase.
,
A:,I'm thinking of adding a new NFT to my collection.
A:,Can anyone suggest a good option from Xanalia?
,
B:,XANALIA has many good NFTs.
B:,You can check out the collection by Yukinori Tokoro.
,
C:,Oh wow!
C:,I'm a huge fan of Tokoro. Just love his photographs
,
A:,Sounds awesome
A:,I really like the way he plays with the concept of time
A:,I will definitely add one of his NFTs to my personal collection.
